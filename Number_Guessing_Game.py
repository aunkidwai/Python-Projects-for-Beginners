"""
Task: Below are the steps:

    + Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
    + Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
    + Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer
      in the minimum number of guesses.
